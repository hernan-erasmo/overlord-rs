# profito-rs (The Liquidator)

The liquidation execution engine that calculates optimal liquidation parameters and submits profitable transactions via MEV-Share and Flashbots.

## Overview

profito-rs is the "profit engine" of overlord-rs. It receives underwater user alerts from vega-rs, replicates AAVE's liquidation logic in Rust for optimal parameter calculation, determines the most profitable liquidation strategy, and crafts MEV bundles for submission to block builders.

## Profit Calculation

Given an underwater user alert (HF < 1), profito-rs answers: _is this user profitable to liquidate?_

The net profitability calculation has three components:

**NetProfit = LiquidationBonus - DeterministicCosts - NonDeterministicCosts**

### 1. Liquidation Bonus Calculation

**LiquidationBonus = DebtRepaid × BonusMultiplier − DebtRepaid**

- `BonusMultiplier` comes from AAVE's liquidation bonus configuration (queryable via `AaveProtocolDataProvider`)
- `DebtRepaid` is determined by iterating over user's collateral reserves and calculating optimal liquidation amounts
- The system determines both _which_ reserve to liquidate and _how much_ based on health factor and close factor thresholds

### 2. Cost Components

**Deterministic Costs:**
- Gas fees: `GasUsed × (BaseFee + PriorityFee)`
- Flash loan fees: `DebtRepaid × FlashLoanRate` (typically 0.05%)
- Slippage costs: `CollateralToReceive × SlippageRate`

**Non-Deterministic Costs:**
- MEV bribes to block builders
- Priority fees for transaction inclusion
- Network congestion adjustments

## Key Features

### 1. AAVE Logic Replication
Implements AAVE v3's liquidation calculation logic in Rust:

```rust
pub struct BestPair {
    pub collateral_asset: Address,           // Asset to liquidate
    pub debt_asset: Address,                 // Debt to repay
    pub net_profit: U256,                   // Expected profit
    pub actual_collateral_to_liquidate: U256, // Liquidation size
    pub actual_debt_to_liquidate: U256,     // Debt amount
    pub liquidation_protocol_fee_amount: U256, // AAVE fees
    pub flash_loan_source: Foxdie::FlashLoanSource, // Optimal source
}
```

### 2. Flash Loan Source Optimization
Intelligently selects the best liquidity source:

1. **Morpho Protocol**: First choice for gas efficiency
2. **AAVE Flash Loans**: Fallback with broader asset support  
3. **Custom Sources**: Additional protocols as needed

```rust
pub async fn get_best_liquidity_provider(
    debt_asset: Address,
    amount: U256,
) -> LiquiditySolution {
    // Check Morpho balance first (cheapest)
    if morpho_balance >= amount {
        return LiquiditySolution { source: MORPHO, .. };
    }
    
    // Fall back to AAVE if enabled
    if aave_flashloan_enabled {
        return LiquiditySolution { source: AAVE, .. };
    }
    
    // No suitable source found
    LiquiditySolution { source: NONE, .. }
}
```

### 3. Swap Fee Calculation
Calculates Uniswap V3 swap fees for accurate profit estimation:
```rust
pub async fn calculate_best_swap_fees(
    token_in: Address,
    token_out: Address, 
    amount_in: U256,
) -> Vec<(U24, U256)> // [(fee_tier, amount_out)]
```

## MEV Bundle Creation

### 1. Bundle Components
Each profitable liquidation generates a bundle containing:

1. **Price Update Transaction**: From oops-rs (when applicable)
2. **Liquidation Transaction**: Call to Foxdie contract
3. **Bribe Transaction**: Payment to block builder

### 2. Bribe Calculation
```rust
const BRIBE_IN_BASIS_POINTS: u16 = 9500; // 95% of profit
let bribe_amount = (net_profit * BRIBE_IN_BASIS_POINTS) / 10000;
```

### 3. MEV-Share Submission
```rust
// Submit bundle with privacy preferences
let bundle = BundleRequest {
    inclusion: InclusionRequest {
        block: target_block,
        max_block: target_block + 3, // 3 block window
    },
    body: transactions,
    privacy: Some(PrivacyHint {
        calldata: true,  // Hide transaction details
        contract_address: true,
        function_selector: true,
        logs: true,
    }),
};
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Price Cache
Maintains cache of asset prices to avoid redundant oracle calls:
```rust
pub struct PriceCache {
    prices: HashMap<Address, (U256, Instant)>, // (price, timestamp)
    ttl: Duration, // Time to live for cached prices
}
```

### 2. Provider Connection Pooling
```rust
pub struct ProviderCache {
    connections: Vec<RootProvider<PubSubFrontend>>,
    current_index: AtomicUsize,
}
```

### 3. Concurrent Processing
Processes multiple liquidation opportunities in parallel:
```rust
// Handle multiple underwater users concurrently
let tasks: Vec<_> = underwater_events
    .into_iter()
    .map(|event| async move {
        process_liquidation_opportunity(event).await
    })
    .collect();

let results = join_all(tasks).await;
```

## Foxdie Contract Integration

profito-rs integrates with a custom liquidation contract (Foxdie) that:

1. **Flash Loan Management**: Handles multiple liquidity sources
2. **Atomic Liquidations**: Ensures all-or-nothing execution
3. **Profit Extraction**: Captures liquidation bonuses efficiently
4. **Gas Optimization**: Minimizes transaction costs

```rust
// Example Foxdie call
let foxdie_call = Foxdie::liquidateCall {
    asset: collateral_asset,
    debt_asset,
    user: underwater_user,
    debt_to_cover: optimal_debt_amount,
    receive_a_token: false, // Receive underlying asset
};
```

## Performance Characteristics

```

## Dependencies

- **alloy**: Ethereum library for contract interactions
- **overlord-shared**: Common types and AAVE bindings
- **mev-share**: MEV-Share client for bundle submission
- **tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent processing

$FinalCollateralReceived = RawCollateralReceived × (1 - slippage)$

$NetProfit = FinalCollateralReceived - DebtRepaid - GasCost$



### 2. Why would we ever want to ask for a refund ETH amount? (only saw this on beaver, btw)
TBA

### 3. What exactly is `slippage rate`? Do we even need to account for it?
$SlippageRate$ is already described above, and it's required because you need to account for the full round trip of the asset. Meaning that if you start with ETH, for example, and use it to liquidate a position for which you might get a different asset as reward, you need to conver that asset back to ETH in order to settle that profit (or loss). You can always keep the reward asset, but you expose yourself to fluctuations on it's price.

### 4. If `CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD` < HF < 1, then only 50% of the debt can be liquidated. If HF < `CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD`, then 100% of the debt can be liquidated. Is `CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD` an attribute of the reserve?

No, `CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD` is hardcoded into the [LiquidationLogic](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/782f51917056a53a2c228701058a6c3fb233684a/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L68C27-L68C63) contract, and it's defined as 0.95e18. If the HF is below 1, but above that, then only 50% can be liquidated. If it's under that value, then you can liquidate 100% of whatever debt you choose.
